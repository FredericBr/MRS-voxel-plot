# MRS-voxel-plot
This code can be used to create MRS voxel and spectra figures in the manner suggested in Truong & Duncan (2020).  
Basic code is presented to show data from a single group but this is easily adapted to show multiple groups. 
# Dependencies
- Numpy (https://numpy.org)
- Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org)
- Nilearn (https://nilearn.github.io)

# Data organisation
The scripts assume that your data are in folders organised in a manner similar to the BIDS standard (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
